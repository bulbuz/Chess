MAIN STRUCTURE OF CHESS PROGRAM
===============================

main loop {
1. print board

2. take input

3. convert input

4. validate user input
    sub steps:
- white or black turn

}

UNFINISHED STUFF

generate occupied squares by each team (pay attention to pawns since their forward movement isn't occupation)

input is valid if the king doesn't get exposed to the enemies occupation squares

pawn movement isn't finished (we have to set a limit on the double movement) 

- pawn promotion
